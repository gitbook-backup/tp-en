# How to import a MultiSig Wallet?

A multi-signature wallet, as the name suggests, is a wallet that requires multiple people to sign to perform an operation. Transferring with a multi-signature wallet often requires >= 1 person to sign and send the transaction before the operation can be completed. When using a multi-signature wallet, we can specify the signature mode of M/N, that is, only M signatures among N persons can complete the operation. For example, the 2/3 signature mode means that two of the three people can sign.

The multi-signature of ETH/ERC20 (including EVM chains such as BSC/BEP20) adopts a lightweight smart contract method.

#### Applicable scenes:
