# What is Owners?

Owners are the managers of the MultiSig Wallet.

By setting 2 more people to jointly manage an address, only the managers sign and agree to use the assets in the address, which greatly reduces the risk of asset loss caused by private keys being leaked.

The most important feature of a Multi-Sig wallet is that wallet transactions require the approval of the private key holders. Ordinary, the "m-n mode" needs to be confirmed when a Multi-Sig wallet is created. Only the "m" holders of the "n" private keys jointly sign and approve the transfer to complete the transfer operation.

"2â€“3 mode" is the most common form of Multi-Sig wallets, every transaction needs to be approved by the 2 private key holders, which can balance the relationship between safety and convenience.
