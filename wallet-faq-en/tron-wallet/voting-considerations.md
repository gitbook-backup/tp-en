# Voting Considerations

1. Voting rewards will vary based on the total number of votes, total votes for super representatives, the number of votes you give to super representatives, the type of super representative, and the profit-sharing ratio set by the super representative. Estimated earnings are for reference only.
2. When you unfreeze TRX, the voting rights obtained through freezing will disappear, and previous votes will become invalid.
3. When canceling a vote, due to Tron network restrictions, the total number of votes must be at least 1. If you want to cancel all votes, you can unfreeze all frozen TRX.
4. Calculation formula for earnings when voting for super representatives (top 27 ranking): Daily earnings = (((Your votes for the super representative) \* 4,608,000 / Total votes) \* profit-sharing ratio) + ((460,800 / 27) \* profit-sharing ratio) \* (Your votes for the super representative) / (Total votes for super representatives) TRX.
5. Calculation formula for earnings when voting for super representative partners: Daily rewards = (((Your votes for the super representative) \* 4,608,000 / Total votes) \* profit-sharing ratio) TRX.
6. Due to block failure or other reasons, actual rewards may differ from the calculated results.
