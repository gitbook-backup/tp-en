# About TRON Account Privilege Escalation

Privilege escalation means that your account privileges will change, generally adding an account address with the same privileges. Privilege escalation can allow this account to obtain control rights such as transfer and voting, thus easily transfer your assets.&#x20;

There are 2 different roles of permission on the TRON chain: Owner (administrator) and Active (active permission). you can edit and set the privileges managed by the Owner or Active account, such as replacing and adding the permission address, and modifying the threshold or weight of the permission address, so as to realize functions such as multi-signature. If the user encounters a malicious execution link and gives approval, another permission address will be added, which will directly lead to the loss of assets.
