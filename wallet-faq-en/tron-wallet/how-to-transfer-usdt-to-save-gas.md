# How to transfer USDT to save gas

Transactions on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks require the payment of a certain amount of Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) as a gas fee.Transfers on TRON consume bandwidth and energy, and when energy and bandwidth are insufficient, TRX is burned. For most users, the gas deduction rates are often confusing during TRON transfer operations, and it may not be clear what options are available to minimize gas consumption.

In this article, TokenPocket will introduce you to the basics of TRON transfers and share methods to minimize gas fees for transferring USDT.

**Firstly, what is the TRON energy and bandwidth?**

Energy and Bandwidth Point of Tron is a resource system for processing and executing smart contracts and transactions.

* Energy: Energy represents the processor resources that are consumed during the running of a smart contract. Like bandwidth, it can be obtained by staking TRX, but no free energy is allocated to each account every day.
* Bandwidth: Primarily utilized for ordinary transactions such as transfers, staking, and unlocks. Each account is allocated 600 free bandwidth credits per day.

When transferring TRX, only bandwidth is consumed, not energy. Transferring a certain amount of TRX results in the burning of 268 bandwidth. On the other hand, transferring TRC20-USDT requires a fee of 13.74 TRX (\~ $1.23) or 27.6 TRX (\~$2.51). However, if you possess sufficient TRON energy and bandwidth, TRX won't be burned as a gas fee; instead, it will consume both bandwidth and energy. Each USDT transfer results in the burning of 345 bandwidth, and the energy burned varies depending on the TRON chain.

Based on the provided example, we can deduce the following points:

1. If the Payer possesses sufficient energy and bandwidth, the transfer process will consume energy and bandwidth as gas.
2. The quantity of energy and bandwidth consumed is closely linked to the availability of USDT in the recipient's account.

It is important to note that when transferring USDT, energy and bandwidth are primarily consumed. If the account lacks energy, TRX will be deducted as a transaction fee. Due to the blockchain's execution mechanism, the TRX fee will not be refunded if the transaction fails. To prevent this scenario, ensure that your account contains an adequate amount of TRX.

**Secondly, how to get Tron energy?**

Energy is not a free resource, therefore to get energy there are three ways you can get it as follows:

1. Get energy by freezing TRX:

The first option involves freezing a minimum of 1980 TRX (\~ $194.5) for 32890 Energy, which remains inaccessible for 14 days following the thawing process. No TRX is lost during the freezing period, and it allows the acquisition of voting rights. However, this approach demands a substantial amount of TRX for freezing.

In contrast, the second method, energy rental, is simpler and more direct, contributing to savings on TRX gas fees. Hence, leasing energy through energy platforms proves to be a more cost-effective choice.

Presently, the primary rental options in the market include the official TRON Energy Rental, TokenPocket Tron Energy Rental, and Telegram's Energy Rental Community.
