# How to claim voting rewards.

Voting requires freezing TRX. For every 1 TRX frozen, you will receive 1 voting right (TRON Power). When you vote for a Super Representative, you will receive a portion of the Super Representative rewards as voting rewards. The specific calculation rules for voting rewards involve the distribution ratio, number of votes, and the number of blocks produced. Please refer to the relevant regulations for detailed information.

To do this, open TokenPocket and go to the "Voting Management" interface. Click on "Claim Rewards" on the interface, and after confirming the transaction details, you will receive the rewards.
