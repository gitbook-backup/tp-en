**Notes:**

1\. Is it safe for users?

It will provide one of the owners permissions to TokenPocket, which is held by a multi-signature account, and only can be used to log in, that permission can be removed by users manually as they need.

2\. Why we need the email/phone number wallet?

Which can reduce the barrier for new users who don't know much about the public/private key pair and the accounting system of the  eos.io.

And it provides a way to recover the private key for those users who may lose asset due to lost the private key or wallet.
