# What is Voice？

**Official introduction:**

Voice is a transparent, rewards-based platform for creating, distributing, and discovering content. It aims to foster a new and trusted experience through identity authentication and transparent database infrastructure. Voice is built by and for its users. Most value is returned back to its community through Voice Tokens, a utility token that can be earned and consumed to acquire the attention of other users on the platform.
