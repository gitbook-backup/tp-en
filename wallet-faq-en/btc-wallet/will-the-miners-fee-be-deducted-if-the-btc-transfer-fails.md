# Will the miner's fee be deducted if the BTC transfer fails?

In the bitcoin network, the transfer requires the miner to package the transaction. But if the deal fails for reasons such as a lack of miners' fee, since the deal has been packaged by the miners, the miner's fee will be deducted and not refunded to the user's account. This is also a feature of the consensus algorithm of POW \(Proof Of Work\).
