# IOST Use Guide（ Activation Code Creation）

Currently, TokenPocket only supports IOST on the Android platform. TP Wallet has not yet added support for the IOST network, and it is not possible to create an IOST wallet through custom network settings at the moment.

3. The IOST account consists of 5 to 11 characters, including lowercase letters, numbers, and \_. You can set it according to your preferences or click on the "Random Account" button on the interface. After setting the account, enter the password and input the "Activation Code." Then, click on "Create Wallet."

In the prompt for the backup mnemonic phrase, you can click on "Advanced Settings" to create a wallet using the Passphrase method. In simple terms, a Passphrase wallet requires both the correct mnemonic phrase and the correct password for management, and both are necessary.

1. Open TokenPocket and select a wallet address that holds tokens, for example, choose the BSC wallet. On the wallet's homepage, click on "Swap," then use USDT on the BSC chain to exchange for IOST. Simply choose the desired tokens for exchange, meet the minimum exchange quantity, select a non-exchange receiving address, and finally click on "Confirm Swap."
