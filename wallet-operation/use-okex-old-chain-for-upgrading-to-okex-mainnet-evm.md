# Use OKEx old chain for upgrading to OKEx mainnet \(EVM\)

Note: please update the TokenPocket wallet to the latest version.

Operation steps: 

1. Open the OKEx old chain wallet. After opening, you can see the \[Wallet Upgrade\] prompt on the upper part of the interface. After clicking, you can see the update prompt content. Here you need to pay attention to: the wallet upgrade is only from the OKEx old chain at the beginning of the ex address. For the new OKEx chain starting with 0x address, its assets also need to be converted from KIP10 to KIP20. You need to deposit the tokens to the OKEx exchange through the wallet first, and then use the KIP20 channel to withdraw to the wallet after receipt.

3. Click on the wallet location \[upper left corner\], select the bottom layer of the main network of the OKEx-EVM icon, and then select the upgraded wallet to open it for using. \(Old chain assets need to be converted through the OKEx Exchange and withdrawn to the OKEx-EVM wallet\)
