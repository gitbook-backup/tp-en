# What is Transaction ID \(Hash\) ?

What is transaction ID \(Hash\):

It is like a fingerprint of data, and the form of expression can be expressed by a string of letters, numbers or other symbols. It can also be understood as: the transaction hash on the blockchain is the transaction number. For example, if we transfer 10 tokens from address A to address B, we will use the address A for private key signature to get a SIGN \(signature\). Then this signature is combined with the transaction, and finally the hash value operation is performed to get TxHash \(hash value\). And then broadcast to the network, if the transaction is successful \(focus\), you can query the transaction number on the blockchain network, which is TxHash. If it is a failed transaction, the data will not be uploaded to the chain and the hash value will naturally be invalid.



Transaction hash usually appear in these locations:

1.When the wallet token is transferred in or out, the transaction hash value will be generated on the transaction details interface. You can query the transaction details on the chain by clicking or copying to the blockchain browser, or you can query through the shortcut entry at the bottom.

2. For token deposit or withdrawal in the exchange, you can see the transaction hash \(some called TxID\) prompts in the transaction details. If you copy the hash, you can go to the blockchain browser to query the transfer details.

Common blockchain explorer:

Open the TokenPocket wallet, click on the top of \[Discover\] to search for \[Browser\] keywords, and then you can view the commonly used browsers, and then click to open for quering.
