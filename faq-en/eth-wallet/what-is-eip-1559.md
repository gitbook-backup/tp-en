**What Is EIP-1559?**

EIP-1559 stands for “**Ethereum Improvement Proposal**”. It will change the fee market mechanism of Ethereum and this change will see gas fees split into two: **Base fee and Tip**. Both of these fees will be transparent for users. 

It will include a tip from the sender to motivate miners to package the transaction during periods of high congestion and a base fee which is then burned.

**Why is EIP-1559 being released?**

In order to solve the problem of low efficiency caused by the current congestion of Ethereum transactions, the EIP-1559 proposal adjusts the gas fee according to actual usage needs, and changes the fee ****structure and flow direction to ensure the utilization rate of the block. The idea is to make fees based on block demand more transparent for the user.

The EIP-1559 proposal can dynamically adjust the upper limit of the Gas fee to cope with short-term transaction congestion, thereby improving transaction efficiency and **improving user experience.**
