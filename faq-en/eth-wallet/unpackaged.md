# Manage the unpackaged transactions

If a transfer or in-DApp payment is initiated when there exists an unsuccessful order, the following prompts will pop up:

\[Manage Unapproved Transaction\] means to accelerate or cancel the previous transaction request.

\[Continue the current transaction\] means to skip the prompt and continue with the current transaction.

\[Cover the Earliest Unapproved Transaction\] means to cancel the previous transaction, and you will need to confirm if the unapproved transaction has important data.
