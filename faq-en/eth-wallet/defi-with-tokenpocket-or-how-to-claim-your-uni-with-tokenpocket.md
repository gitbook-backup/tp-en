## Liquid Mining in Uniswap <a id="70ff"></a>

The first round of liquid mining program on Uniswap was launched at 12:00, Sep 18, 2020, UTC, and will last until 12:00, Nov 17, 2020, UTC. The first round includes the following four liquidity pools:

* ETH/USDT
* ETH/USDC
* ETH/DAI
* ETH/WBTC

5,000,000 UNI will be allocated per pool to LPs proportional to liquidity, which roughly translates to:

* 83,333.33 UNI per pool per day
* 13.5 UNI UNI per pool per block

These UNI are not subject to vesting or lock up. After 30 days, governance will reach its vesting cliff and Uniswap governance will control all UNI vested to the Uniswap treasury. At this point, governance can vote to allocate UNI towards grants, strategic partnerships, governance initiatives, additional liquidity mining pools, and other programs.

You can also participate in the Uniswap liquidity mining with TokenPocket. See the following steps.
