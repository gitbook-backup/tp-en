**1. The Road to Beta**\
Six months ago, our CEO Brendan Blumer, and CTO Dan Larimer, went on a bit of a rant in a packed Washington D.C. auditorium. The subject? The state of social media.

**3. A Regulatory Recap**\

**4. Beta (to start) in the USA**\
Followed by a steady rollout to English speaking territories, then globally.
