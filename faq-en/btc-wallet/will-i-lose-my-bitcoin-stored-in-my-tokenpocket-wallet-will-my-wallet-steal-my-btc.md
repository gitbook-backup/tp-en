# Will I lose my bitcoin stored in my TokenPocket wallet? Will my wallet steal my BTC?

No. Strictly speaking, whether you lose your bitcoin in your wallet depends on whether your private key is lost or stolen. As a decentralized wallet, the TokenPocket wallet does not store the user's private key, so there is no permission to transfer the user's assets. Please keep your private key safe.
