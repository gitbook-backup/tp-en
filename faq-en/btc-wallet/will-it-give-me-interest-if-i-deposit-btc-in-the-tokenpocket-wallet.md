# Will it give me interest if I deposit BTC in the TokenPocket wallet?

TokenPocket as a decentralized wallet, your BTC assets are stored on the blockchain, and the wallet is only used as a management tool to synchronize the data information on the blockchain. So BTC is not stored in the wallet, which does not charge users any fees or provide any interest.
