# What coins are on the BTC network?

Unlike ETH, EOS and other public blockchains which support the development of smart contracts, the bitcoin network currently only have BTC and USDT. The USDT is known as OMNI (if you see it on an exchange). Some users may mention fork coins such as BCH, but they are not part of the bitcoin network.
