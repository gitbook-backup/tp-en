# What‘s the private key

A private key is a sophisticated form of cryptography that allows a user to access his or her cryptocurrency. It's the “password” for the owner's digital wallet technically.

Anybody else who discovers the private key can steal the tokens, so it must be kept safe like jewels or cash. For example, it must not be typed into any website.
