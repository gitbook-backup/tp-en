# ðŸ†• Sept 27th, Notice of the Suspension of Self-built KCC Mainnet Nodes and On-chain Data Services

Dear TokenPocket users,

To ensure the provision of high-quality nodes and on-chain data services for TokenPocket users, TokenPocket will regularly evaluate data of all listed public chains, and may suspend the data services due to multiple factors.&#x20;



When evaluating public chains, we will consider various factors and make conscious decisions to suspend services. Below are a few evaluation criteria considered when suspending self-built public chain nodes and on-chain data services,

* Whether the public chain project is actively operated.
* Transaction volume of the public chain.
* Liquidity of the public chain tokens.
* Increase or decrease in the number of DApps operating on the public chain.
* Community maintenance status.
* Operation status of the public chain nodes.
* Contributions to the construction of the blockchain ecosystem.



Based on the above evaluation criteria, we have decided to suspend the self-built nodes and data operational services for the following public chains from September 27, 2023, 15:00 (UTC+8):&#x20;

* **KCC Mainnet**\
