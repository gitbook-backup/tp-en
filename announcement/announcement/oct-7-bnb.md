Dear TokenPocket users,\


According to the BNB Chain official, BNB Chain (BSC) is undergoing maintenance. This maintenance will affect the transfer function, and all transfer operations on BNB Chain will be suspended during the maintenance period. Your assets are stored on the chain, the maintenance will not affect asset security. TokenPocket will keep following the maintenance and will announce after the maintenance is completed.\


Please don't trust anyone who claims to be an official. Anyone who private messages with you is a scammer! Don't share the private key and secret recovery phrase with anyone, please be vigilant! Sorry for the inconvenience!
