# ðŸ”¥ Sept 12th. About the Ethereum Merge.

TokenPocket will support the Ethereum Merge on Sept 15th, 2022. To ensure your assetsâ€˜s security, we recommend that you donâ€™t execute the transfer, stake, and other operations on Ethereum. For users who need to execute the transfer operation, we recommended that you complete the transfer operation before Sept 15th.

Any funds held in your wallet before the Merge will still be accessible after the Merge. No action is required to upgrade on your part.

In the process of the Merge, it will not affect your asset security, you don't need to worry about it.

As we approach the Merge of Ethereum Mainnet, you should be on high alert for scams trying to take advantage of users during this transition. Do not send your ETH anywhere in an attempt to "upgrade to ETH2." There is no "ETH2" token, and there is nothing more you need to do for your funds to remain safe.

TokenPocket will release an announcement to inform you after the Ethereum Merge is completed. Please be patient.



**What's Ethereum Merge?**

The Merge represents the joining of the existing execution layer of Ethereum (the Mainnet we use today) with its new proof-of-stake consensus layer, the Beacon Chain. It eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining and instead secures the network using staked ETH. A truly exciting step in realizing the Ethereum vision â€“ more scalability, security, and sustainability.

**What do users and holders need to do to get ready?**

You do not need to do anything to protect your funds entering The Merge.

Any funds held in your wallet before The Merge will still be accessible after The Merge. No action is required to upgrade on your part.
