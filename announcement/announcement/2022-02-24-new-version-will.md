# 2022/02/24 New version will adjust some functions and service.

In order to comply with the App Store review guidelines, TokenPocket has announced that it will release a new version on the App Store, which will remove the DApp data section of the “Discovery” page, but keep DApp browser historical data, and users still can search and favorite DApps. This process has no impact on the security of users' assets.
