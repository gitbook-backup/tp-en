# 🔥 The Merge is over!

**The Merge is over. From now on, all the users can execute the transfer and stake on Ethereum and all the functions are back to normal now！**

**What's Ethereum Merge?**

The Merge represents the joining of the existing execution layer of Ethereum (the Mainnet we use today) with its new proof-of-stake consensus layer, the Beacon Chain. It eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining and instead secures the network using staked ETH. A truly exciting step in realizing the Ethereum vision – more scalability, security, and sustainability.

**What do users and holders need to do?**

Any funds held in your wallet before The Merge will still be accessible after The Merge. No action is required to upgrade on your part.

Do not send your ETH anywhere in an attempt to "upgrade to ETH2." There is no "ETH2" token, and there is nothing more you need to do for your funds to remain safe.
