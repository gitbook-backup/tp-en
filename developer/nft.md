**3.** [**Checksum Address** ](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/address/)

For ERC20 tokens, you need to submit the checksum address that includes uppercase and lowercase characters. You can find the checksum address of a token by searching contract address on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/). After searching, the checksum address will be shown in the upper left corner. For example, the checksum address of USDT is 0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954 EedeAC495271d0F.
