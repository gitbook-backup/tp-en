3\. If the assets have not been shown on TokenPoket, you just need to copy the contract address and paste it on the \[+] on TokenPocket's Assets page. **(**[**How to add token?**](https://help.tokenpocket.pro/en/token-management/how-to-add-tokens)**)**

<mark style="color:orange;">**Attention: The contract address is the only criterion for distinguishing the real tokens. When adding tokens, do not directly enter the token's name.**</mark>
