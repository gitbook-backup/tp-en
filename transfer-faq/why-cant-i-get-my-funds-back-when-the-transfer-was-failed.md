# Why can't I get my funds back when the transfer was failed?

When the transfer was failed on TokenPocket wallet, it is usually caused by the following three reasons:&#x20;

1. Out of gas
2. Bad instruction&#x20;
3. Reverted&#x20;

If a transfer fails, TokenPocket will not deduct your assets, and you can check your assets on the \[Assets] page.

&#x20;It should be noted that **the** **miner fee generated by this transfer will not be refunded.** It is not that TokenPocket "stolen" your miner fee, but because this transaction has been packaged by the miner, which means that the miner fee has been collected by the miner.
