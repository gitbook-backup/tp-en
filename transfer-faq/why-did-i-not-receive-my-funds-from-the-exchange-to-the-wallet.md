# Why did I not receive my funds from the exchange to the wallet?

First, the route of transfer on the blockchain is divided into three steps: **Transfer from the exchange - Confirmation on the blockchain - Transfer into the wallet.** 

If you didn't receive your assets when depositing tokens/coins from the exchange to TokenPocket, please follow the steps below: 

1. Confirm whether the exchange/centralized wallet transfers money to the withdrawal address. If the transfer is initiated, a transaction hash will be generated, and the user can confirm whether the transfer has been initiated through the transaction hash. 2. Check the transaction details on the chain. Due to network congestion or the gas fee setting is too low, Pending or Fail may appear, indicating that the transaction has not been completed. At this time, please wait patiently for the block to pack your transaction, or consult the exchange The customer service requested to cancel the transaction, and then re-initiate a transfer with a higher gas fee.
