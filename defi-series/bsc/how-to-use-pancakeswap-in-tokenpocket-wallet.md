# How to use PancakeSwap in TokenPocket Wallet

**BSC (Binance Smart Chain) **

The Binance Smart Chain is an innovative solution to bring EVM-enabled programmability and cross-chain interoperability to the Binance Chain. It relies on 21 verifiers out of the block, and the system follows the POSA (Proof of Staked Authority) consensus algorithm. The speed is very fast, and it has low fees. Verifiers are selected based on the number of tokens they are bound to. The security and stability of on-chain transactions are also achieved by binding the verifier through penalty mechanisms such as preventing multiple signatures. BSC is fully compatible with the ETH ecosystem and natively supports cross-chain operation. Cross-chain transactions and information exchange can be done easily on BSC. Assets in both blockchains (ETH and BSC) can be traded on DEX. Users can either enjoy the high-performance aggregation engine of DEX or complete their own development on BSC.

**PancakeSwap **

PancakeSwap is the number one automated market maker (AMM) on Binance Smart Chain, which allows exchange two different tokens. It is fast, cheap, and everyone can participate.

2\. The top of DApp is the main function area (PC access will see the voting and other functions not yet opened, mobile will also support later), in the 【Swap】, we just need to set the tokens to be exchanged and the number of tokens (automatic matching) according to the information at the bottom of the slip point, handling fee and other information to confirm and then click Swap to authorize.

**Staking **

1\. 1 CAKE = 1 SYRUP, staking CAKE (pancake tokens) to get SYRUP, holding SYRUP will not only get you CAKE rewards, but will also be used for subsequent functions such as pancake exchange lottery and general governance. The first operation requires authorization 【Approve CAKE】, click the blue【+】to add CAKE tokens after authorization is complete.

2\. Set the number of CAKE to be staked, and click 【Confirm】to see the number of CAKE staked, the number of CAKE rewards that can be harvested and the number of SYRUP redeemed at the top after successful authorization (the voting function is not yet open, so no screenshot is taken). When we don't need to stake, click【Unstake】to finish the operation of collecting rewards and redeeming CAKE tokens.
