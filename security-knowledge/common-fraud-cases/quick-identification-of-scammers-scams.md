**Scam No.2 -** Impersonating TokenPocket Telegram Community Admin to cheat

After joining the Telegram community of the TokenPocket wallet, users will automatically receive a warning message to guard against scams, but this still cannot attract all users' attention.

The form may contain information such as asking the user to submit the private key or mnemonic. The interface of the form may contain words such as TokenPocket (fake it as the real), which makes users to relax their vigilance and follow the layout of the scammer, and then users' assets will be took by scammer.
