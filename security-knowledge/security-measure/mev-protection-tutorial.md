# MEV Protection Tutorial

**What is an MEV attack?**

MEV, in a sandwich attack, involves front-running. A user's transaction triggers a bot to strategically execute a buy before and sell after profiting from price differences and the front-running tactic.

**How to prevent MEV?**

To avoid MEV attacks, you can send your transactions to some private nodes (e.g. Flashbots) to ensure that your transactions are executed properly. If you send a transaction to a private node, you need to wait for the transaction to be uploaded before confirming its status so the transaction will be a bit slower.

**TokenPocket's MEV protection feature will reduce slippage and avoid MEV attacks, making transactions more secure.**

**Note:**

1. MEV Protection is available in the "Swap" function.
2. MEV Protection does not support smart wallets and multi-sig wallets.
3. Ethereum Chain and BSC Chain are supported.

## Tutorial
