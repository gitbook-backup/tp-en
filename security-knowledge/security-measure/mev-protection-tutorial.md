# MEV Protection Tutorial

**What is an MEV attack?**

MEV attackers realize arbitrage through a "sandwich attack" (commonly known as clip), i.e., buying before the user and selling after the user buys.&#x20;

**How to prevent MEV?**

To avoid MEV attacks, you can send your transactions to some private nodes (e.g. Flashbots) to ensure that your transactions are executed properly. If you send a transaction to a private node, you need to wait for the transaction to be uploaded before confirming its status so the transaction will be a bit slower.

**TokenPocket's MEV protection feature will reduce slippage and avoid MEV attacks, making transactions more secure.**

**Note:**

1. MEV Protection is available in the "Swap" function.
2. MEV Protection does not support smart wallets and multi-sig wallets wallets at this time.
3. Ethereum Chain and BSC Chain are supported.

## Tutorial
