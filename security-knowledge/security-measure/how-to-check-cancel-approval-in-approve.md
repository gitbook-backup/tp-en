# How to check/cancel Approval in \[Approve] ？

Approve means authorization. It allows users who hold tokens to authorize a certain amount to a specified account by calling the Approve method, giving the account the right to freely spend the Token within the quota. If approved to malicious accounts or contract address, then approved assets will be extremely risky.
