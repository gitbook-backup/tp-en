# Hide small transaction records

Recently, many TokenPocket users find out that there are many “0 USDT” transaction records that appear on TokenPockte transaction records, causing some users to worry about asset security.

**To help users to stay away from the “0 USDT” phishing transfer scan, TokenPocket’s latest version(Android 1.6.6) optimizes and launches a new function: Hide small transaction records.**

### Why “0 USDT” transfer scam will appear in my wallet? <a href="#0483" id="0483"></a>

This operation is performed directly through the “TransferFrom” function of the USDT, any address can be invoked and generate a transfer record in the wallet and a “Cancelled” record in the Approvals. By the way, please note that this situation may occur in all public chains including EVM-based chains, TRON, etc.

The purpose of this operation is to simulate the transaction from the user’s address, combined with the disguised address to induce the user to misoperate the transfer, it won’t affect your asset’s security, but please be aware of this possible misoperation execution.
