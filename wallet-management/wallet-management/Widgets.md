# How to use Widgets

### <mark style="color:orange;">**What is Widget?**</mark>

Widget is not a small App. Instead, it is a new form of desktop content display, mainly used to display the data that users care about but the main application cannot do in time.

The new version of TokenPocket supports the Widgets function, which can put the NFT, market, price, gas and other contents we use daily on the mobile phone desktop.
