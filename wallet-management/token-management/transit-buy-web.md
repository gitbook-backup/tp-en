1. Open the TokenPocket plugin wallet, click on \[Buy], and enter the Transit Buy trading interface. The default screen is the Buy screen. After setting the exchange amount and token type, click \[Next] to proceed to the next screen.

You can select different fiat currencies from different countries here (for example, USD is selected here), and below, you can choose from supported target tokens (this tutorial uses USD to USDT exchange as an example).

2. Once inside the interface, select \[Payment] and choose a payment method from the list. For example, here we choose \[Google Pay] as the payment method. You can directly enter the receiving address for the tokens in the payment address field, or you can click the wallet icon to select an address that you have already imported into TokenPocket as the receiving address. You can also choose the service provider below, for example, select the Transak service provider. Click \[Next] to proceed to the next screen.

3. The interface will automatically redirect to the service provider's dedicated page, with \[Google Pay] selected by default. Click \[Buy Now], and you will be asked to enter your email address and receive a verification code via email for login.

4.After logging in, if it's your first time using it, you may need to undergo KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. Once the verification is completed, you can access the payment interface for the exchange.
