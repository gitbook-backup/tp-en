Here, you can choose the fiat currency of different countries (for example, here we have selected USD), and you can select supported tokens as the exchange target tokens below (this tutorial uses USD to USDT exchange as an example).

In the receiving address field, you can directly enter the address where you want to receive the tokens, or you can click on the wallet icon to select an address that you have already imported into TokenPocket as the receiving address. You can also choose the service provider below, for example, select the Transak service provider. Scroll down to the bottom of the interface, and click \[Next] to proceed to the next screen.

3. The interface will automatically redirect to the service provider's dedicated page, with \[Google Pay] selected by default. Click \[Buy Now], and you will be asked to enter your email address and receive a verification code via email for login. After logging in, if it's your first time using it, you may need to complete KYC verification. Once the verification is completed, you can access the exchange details, and then click \[Confirm] to proceed to the final payment page.
