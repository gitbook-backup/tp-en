# What is an extension wallet?

Extension wallet refers to a software that runs on a web browser (mainly Google chrome); It includes the basic operations of general wallets, such as transfers, authorization to call contracts, and import/export/create wallet accounts.

The browser extension is a kind of light wallet. Like the APP, it does not need to synchronize the data of the whole node, and does not store the wallet information. All the private keys and passwords of extension wallets are held by the users themselves.
