# What is a watch wallet?

A watch wallet is essentially a block explorer that observes the data on a chain of a specific address.

Users only need to import the account (public key) or address to enjoy the watch wallet easily, where they can view the account (address) assets, transaction records and other information. But the watch wallet cannot directly perform transfer and other on-chain operations. If you need to transfer, you have to import the private key or mnemonic into the wallet.
