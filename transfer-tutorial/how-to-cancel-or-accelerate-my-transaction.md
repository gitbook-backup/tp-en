# How to Cancel/Accelerate My Transaction?

**How to cancel a transaction?**

3. After checking the information, click \[Confirm\];  
Note: The principle of canceling a transaction is to re-initiate a transfer of the same amount to cover the original transaction you sent, and this process also needs to be executed on chain, so a small amount of miner fee is still required.
