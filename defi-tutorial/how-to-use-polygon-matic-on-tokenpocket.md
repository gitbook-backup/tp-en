**About Polygon Bridge**  
If you want to move funds from Ethereum to Polygon, you must go through the so-called "bridge", and the "bridge" works through a locking and exit mechanism. On Polygon, users can choose to use two types of bridges: **Plasma Bridge** and **PoS Bridge**. Plasma ****provides advanced security with plasma exit mechanism. It will take **7 days** to transfer your funds back to Etnereum, while the PoS security will only take about **3 hours** back to Etnereum since it is provided by the PoS validators. 

We will take PoS Bridge as an example to show how to move funds from Ethereum to Polygon.

1.Click \[Discover\] on the bottom of TokenPocket, and then search \[Polygon Bridge\];
